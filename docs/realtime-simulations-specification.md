# Real-Time Sales & Service Simulations - Technical Specification
**Date:** August 2025  
**Project:** Sales Training Platform - Real-Time AI Simulations

## 🎯 Executive Summary

This document outlines the specification for building advanced real-time voice simulations that will transform your sales training platform into a true "sales gym" experience. The system will use OpenAI's latest real-time capabilities combined with analysis-driven customer personas to create hyper-realistic training scenarios.

## 🔍 Current System Analysis

### ✅ What Works Well
- **Excellent call analysis foundation** - GPT-4 based analysis with precise timestamped quotes
- **Robust audio processing** - Support for all formats including WMA with automatic conversion
- **Smart error handling** - Advanced JSON parsing with intelligent fallbacks
- **Comprehensive user management** - Dynamic quotas and role-based permissions
- **Strong technical foundation** - Next.js, Supabase, TypeScript with excellent patterns

### 🚧 Current Simulation Limitations
- **Basic implementation** - Simple WebSocket with placeholder responses
- **Static scenarios** - Fixed prompts not adapted to agent analysis
- **No voice integration** - Text-based only, no real-time voice
- **Limited personalization** - Scenarios don't leverage company data or agent weaknesses

## 🚀 Vision: Next-Generation Real-Time Simulations

### Core Concept
Transform static analysis into **dynamic, personalized voice training experiences** where:
- AI customers respond in real-time based on agent's specific weaknesses
- Scenarios adapt dynamically using company questionnaire data
- Voice conversations feel natural and challenging
- Training directly targets improvement areas identified in analysis

## 🏗️ Proposed Architecture

### 1. AI-Driven Customer Persona Engine
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Agent Analysis Data] --> B[Persona Generator]
    C[Company Data] --> B
    D[Call History] --> B
    B --> E[Dynamic Customer Profile]
    E --> F[Behavior Instructions]
    E --> G[Objection Patterns]
    E --> H[Communication Style]
    F --> I[Real-Time AI Customer]
    G --> I
    H --> I
```

**Components:**
- **Analysis Parser**: Extracts weaknesses from agent's call analysis
- **Company Context Engine**: Uses questionnaire data for industry-specific scenarios
- **Persona Builder**: Creates detailed customer profiles targeting specific improvement areas
- **Behavior Generator**: Defines how AI customer should react to different approaches

### 2. Real-Time Voice System Architecture
```typescript
// High-level architecture
interface RealTimeSimulation {
  // Voice Processing
  audioInput: WebRTCStream
  audioOutput: WebRTCStream
  
  // AI Integration
  openaiRealtimeAPI: OpenAIRealtimeConnection
  contextEngine: PersonaContextEngine
  
  // Analysis Integration
  agentProfile: AgentAnalysisData
  companyContext: CompanyQuestionnaireData
  
  // Real-time Features
  liveTranscription: LiveTranscriptStream
  emotionDetection: EmotionAnalysisStream
  performanceTracking: RealTimeMetrics
}
```

### 3. OpenAI Integration Strategy

Based on August 2025 capabilities:

#### Primary Approach: OpenAI Realtime API + Agent Framework
```typescript
// Using latest OpenAI capabilities
const simulationConfig = {
  // New Agent SDK for complex scenarios
  agent: {
    tools: [
      'company_objection_handler',
      'customer_background_generator', 
      'scenario_difficulty_adjuster'
    ],
    responses_api: true, // For structured responses
    real_time_voice: true
  },
  
  // GPT-4o voice mode for natural conversation
  voice_model: 'gpt-4o-realtime',
  language: 'hebrew',
  
  // Dynamic instruction generation
  instructions: generatePersonaInstructions(agentAnalysis, companyData)
}
```

#### Fallback: Enhanced WebSocket + GPT-4o Voice
If Realtime API isn't available, use:
- WebSocket for real-time communication
- GPT-4o voice mode for audio processing
- Streaming responses for natural conversation flow

## 📊 Persona Generation System

### 1. Analysis-Driven Persona Creation

```typescript
interface PersonaGenerator {
  // Input data
  agentWeaknesses: string[]
  companyData: CompanyQuestionnaire
  callHistory: CallAnalysis[]
  
  // Generated persona
  createPersona(): CustomerPersona {
    return {
      // Personality targeting weaknesses
      personality: this.buildTargetedPersonality(),
      
      // Industry-specific context
      background: this.buildIndustryBackground(),
      
      // Objection patterns to practice
      objectionStyle: this.buildObjectionStrategy(),
      
      // Communication preferences
      communicationStyle: this.buildCommunicationStyle(),
      
      // Success criteria
      conversionTriggers: this.buildConversionTriggers()
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment

```typescript
class DifficultyEngine {
  adjustDifficulty(currentPerformance: RealTimeMetrics): void {
    if (currentPerformance.confidence > 0.8) {
      this.increaseObjections()
      this.addTimeConstraints()
    } else if (currentPerformance.confidence < 0.4) {
      this.provideSupportiveResponses()
      this.offerHints()
    }
  }
}
```

## 🎭 Scenario Types Based on Analysis

### 1. Weakness-Targeted Scenarios

### 2. Company-Specific Scenarios
Using questionnaire data:
- **B2B vs B2C** → Different conversation styles and decision makers
- **Industry Context** → Relevant terminology and pain points

### 3. Progressive Skill Building
- **Foundation Level** → Basic conversation flow and product knowledge
- **Intermediate** → Handling objections and building rapport
- **Advanced** → Complex sales scenarios and difficult customers
- **Expert** → Multi-stakeholder sales and enterprise scenarios
